# Crystal-Game
This is my crystal game I made during the Richmond Coding Bootcamp, you get a random answer and have to get to the answer by clicking the crystals, sounds simple? Well the crystals value is kept hidden until you click it, so it takes a fair bit of skill to get to the answer, that is unless you find a crystal that has the value of 1, then it's too easy...
