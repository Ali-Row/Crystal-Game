# Crystal-Game
This is my crystal game I made during the Richmond Coding Bootcamp, you get a random target number and have to get to it by clicking the gems, sounds simple? Well the gems value is kept hidden until you click it, so it takes a fair bit of skill to get to the answer, that is unless you find a gem that has the value of 1, then it's way too easy...

Fun fact about this one, I made the sounds myself in FL Studio, I've been trying to keep my audio background alive!
